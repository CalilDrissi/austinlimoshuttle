"""
The driver app: a mobile-first portal where a chauffeur sees their own runs and
reports progress.

Deliberately server-rendered and JavaScript-free: it reuses Django's auth and
session, and the dashboard's Bootstrap, so there is no API or SPA to maintain.
A driver only ever sees bookings assigned to their own Driver record.
