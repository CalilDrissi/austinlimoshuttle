Stripe gateway.

Card details never pass through here. The browser sends them straight to Stripe
Elements; we handle a PaymentIntent and, afterwards, a brand and a last-4 that
Stripe gives back for display. That is what takes this application out of PCI
scope, and it is why the legacy failure -- 3,416 card numbers in the database --
cannot recur regardless of what anyone writes later.

Credentials come from `PaymentSettings`, managed in the dashboard and encrypted
at rest. They are read per call rather than cached at import, so changing them
in the settings page takes effect immediately.
