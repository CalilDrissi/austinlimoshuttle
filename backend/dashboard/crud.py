"""
Managed records: the screens that replace Django's admin.

The client is never to be sent to /admin/, which means every model a staff
member needs must have a screen here. Written once as a small registry rather
than as seven near-identical sets of list/create/edit/delete views, because
seven copies drift -- one grows a permission check, another forgets the search
box, and nobody notices until a Dispatcher can edit a rate card.

Anything with genuinely bespoke behaviour stays a hand-written view: the two
singleton settings screens, and the payment credentials, which are write-only.
