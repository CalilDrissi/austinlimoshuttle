"""
The fare engine.

A pure function: no request, no session, no database writes. That is what makes
it testable against nine years of historical bookings, which is the only way to
know a rewrite prices identically to the system it replaces.

Legacy equivalent (for reference during the replay):
  * bands        -- includes/functionClassFront.php :: calculate_price_about_distance()
  * surcharges   -- pickup_details.php:329-340
  * fee & floor  -- car_selection.php:216-260

Order of operations, which legacy establishes by statement sequence rather than
by design:

    1. base fare        cumulative distance bands, or hours x hourly rate
    2. surcharge        (blackout% + late-night%) applied ONCE to the base
    3. meet & greet     flat fee, added after the surcharge
    4. minimum fare     floor, applied last

Step 2 is the one that is easy to get wrong. Legacy sums the percentages and
applies the total once:

    $increase_amount = $busy_dates + $special_time;
    $fare = $fare + ($increase_amount / 100 * $fare);

Applying them sequentially would compound: a 40% event date at 22:00 is +60%,
not +68%.
