Surcharge rules and pricing configuration.

Legacy behaviour this reproduces exactly (see legacy/pickup_details.php:329-340):

    if ($time < 06:00:00 || $time > 21:00:00)  -> add the late-night percentage
    if the date is a blackout date             -> add that date's percentage

The two percentages are ADDED and applied once to the base fare -- not applied
sequentially. Getting that wrong inflates every surcharged fare.

Legacy stored the late-night window as an English sentence in
`limousin_special_time_rate.title` while the real hours were hardcoded in PHP,
so the admin screen described behaviour the system did not actually have. Here
the times are the rule.
