"""
Payment endpoints.

The checkout sequence:

  1. POST /api/payments/intent/   -> client secret + publishable key
  2. The browser confirms the card with Stripe Elements. Card details go
     directly from the customer to Stripe; they never touch this server.
  3. Stripe calls /api/payments/webhook/ -> the booking is confirmed.

Step 3 is authoritative. The browser's return from checkout is a hint, not
proof: it can be forged, and it can simply not arrive when a customer closes
the tab. The legacy system confirmed orders on the browser's say-so.
